# SpeechGPT
To use our model:
- Clone the repository
- Install all required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the script by executing `python inference.py`
- Please note the data is too large to store here and is required to be downloaded all at once so it was not able to be included in the zipfile
- When you run our program the data will download but there is also a link available on our web https://huggingface.co/datasets/librispeech_asr/
- An audio file of the word "seven" is included to test our preprocessing functions.
